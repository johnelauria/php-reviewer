        \tThis application serves as a practice exam to help anyone who are about to take the Zend
        PHP Certification. A total of 900+ questions are available, ranging from topics in PHP5 to
        PHP7.1.

        \n\n\tSince this is a free version, this application contains ads. The first set of 150
        questions are already available, but the remaining 750 must be unlocked by watching ads from the
        main menu. Watching a video unlocks 15 questions. You may keep watching until you unlock all
        900 questions.

        \n\n\tIf you wish to unlock all questions and remove all ads in this application, you may
        purchase the
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twopixeled.zendreviewer">paid
        version of the app</a>

        \n\n\tJust like the real exam, questions are always provided in random order, so that when
        re-taking the exam, a different set of questions are provided for you. Answer options are
        also randomised to make sure you understand the correct answer rather than the order of
        answers during the next time you see the question again.

        \n\n\tWe believe, from our experience, that one of the most effective ways to increase the
        chances of passing the exam is to learn from your mistakes in practice exams, just like this
        one! But your best friend for this will always be php.net.
